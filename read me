I have started this assignment by following tutorial and it was good until i got an eorrorin code. In seed data file i forgot to add public and that why i got eorror it was vary haerd to find it but afteer some time i found it ad sol that problem. For the controller model file i did the same mistake like I wrote small d so i was also a tiny mistake. And alst mistake was that i added 5 id and after rading in assigenment i had to add one more so i add that update that database and seed file. that was the all mistake i did in this assigenment.
